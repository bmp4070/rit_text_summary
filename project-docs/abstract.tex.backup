In this age of the Internet, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are the key sources to provide information
required by users. However, with extensive usage of available data, a secondary level of wrappers that interact with NLP
tools have become necessary. These tools must extract a concise summary from the primary data set retrieved. 
The main reson for using text summarization techniques is to obtain this secondary level of information.
Text summarization using NLP techniques is an interesting area of research with various implications for information retrieval. 

	This report deals with the use of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) for generic text summarization and compares 
it with other models available. It proposes text summarization using LSA with usage of open-source NLP frameworks 
like Mahout and Lucene. LSA algorithm can be scaled to multiple large sized documents using these frameworks.
The performance of this algorithm is compared with other models commonly used for summarization and Recall-Oriented
Understudy of Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) scores.  The goal is also to extend the evaluation of algorithms
beyond English language documents to foreign languages, in this case, Hindi.
